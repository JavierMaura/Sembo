Project created using template ASP.NET Core Web API from Visual Studio 2019

To hash the email, i've used https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha1-hash-generator/

PostMan to test the response from Sembo's API

To convert the JSON response to C#, i've used https://json2csharp.com/

I've added a GlobalData class to make the code more clear.

Looking the respone i've noticed that the hotels can be repeated, so i should not take the Top 3 but the DISTINCT Top 3.

I've tried the parallel loop but it gives me some exceptions, so i've used the task approach. Net 6 comes with a new ParallelLoopAsync method that could be helpful.
